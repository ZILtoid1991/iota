## Audio

### Windows

Only WASAPI output is supported at the moment, but it seems to work correctly. Buffer overflow protection is done through spinning in a loop alongside with the wait. It's not nice, but works, and eliminates possible issues from inconsistent buffer sizes. This might be a source of some audio glitches if my ears don't cheat.

Deinitialization is automatic through destructors and bug free. Windows-specific error-codes are handled as should.
