# Purpose of the library

This library was developed with the purposes of:
* having a D language native solution for directmedia layers (e.g. SDL, SFML, GLFW),
* not include things that are also included in the D standard library,
* make it memory safe,
* make it as fast as its possible while also having garbage collection, etc.
